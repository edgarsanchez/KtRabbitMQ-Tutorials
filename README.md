# KtRabbitMQ-Tutorials
Kotlin implementation of [RabbitMQ tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html), specifically based on the [Java samples](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-tutorials/tree/master/java) available in github. So far I've got implemented:

* The ["Hello World!" tutorial](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-java.html)
  * The src/Send.kt file contains the Sender console app
  * The src/Recv.kt folder contains the Receive console app

All the examples assume a RabbitMQ server installation on the local computer.

Comments and feedback welcomed!
